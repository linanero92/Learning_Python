# for Loops

"""
Youâ€™re making a shopping cart program.
The shopping cart is declared as a list of prices, and you need to add functionality to apply a discount and output the total price.

Take the discount percentage as input, calculate and output the total price for the shopping cart.
Use a for loop to iterate over the list.
Use the following formula to calculate the result of X% discount on $Y price: Y - (Y*X/100)

for prise in cart:
    d_prise = prise - (prise * discount / 100)
    total = total + d_prise
